## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### Observations

- Tried to make responsive page without using media queries, but there is still one media query - when the viewport gets big enough to have 3 grid columns, make certain grid items span 2 rows, but not before that. Any ideas to do this without a media query are appreciated.


### Useful resources

- [My Basic Template](https://github.com/je-jo/basic-template) pretty much based on Stephanie Eckless' [HTML / Sass Jumpstart](https://github.com/5t3ph/html-sass-jumpstart) but much simpler;
- [grid-column-end](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/grid-column-end/) - css-tricks almanac, helped with grid items placement;
